### Experience

#### [GitHub](http://github.com/) (2013 - Present)
Hired as a GitHub Enterprise Automated Testing Engineer. Spotted that the main goal was to improve quality of GitHub Enterprise so pivoted my job to improving the quality for [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) through bugfixing and improving manual QA, CI, packaging, deployment, automation and ChatOps around the release process.

#### [AllTrails](http://alltrails.com/) (2012 - 2013)
Full stack engineer developing Rails/MySQL back-end and Coffeescript/SASS front-end for [AllTrails](http://alltrails.com/) and [AllSnow](http://allsnow.com). Improved product quality by introducing code review process using GitHub pull requests, CI and automatic deployment using Jenkins and moving some services to AWS-managed infrastructure. Developed features, APIs and optimized performance.

#### [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/) (2009 - Present)
Maintainer. Improved quality by starting a [successful Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homebrew/brew-test-bot)to create a CI system for Homebrew. Installed servers into data-centre and keep them running. Coordinate with other maintainers, provide (flat) project leadership, onboard new maintainers and mentor active contributors to become future maintainers. Invented Homebrew binary packages (bottles), fix users issues and develop features.

#### [KDAB](http://kdab.com/) (2009 - 2012)
Technical team lead providing international cross-platform consultancy. Led several project teams who always delivered on time and in budget. Deputy manager of a mostly remote team and received management mentorship/training. Created a new CI system which replaced the previous one to improve project quality and company productivity. Generated successful sales leads and sold a six figure contract. Regularly travelled internationally to teach other software engineers, solve hard problems and kick off projects to consistently positive customer feedback.

Ported Qt/MSVC++ application from Windows to CMake, OS X and Linux. Proposed, implemented the [successful](http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-features/mendeley-desktop-the-mvc-strikes-back/) [rewrite](http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-features/mendeley-desktop-the-about-dialogue-and-the-refactor/) of problematic contracted legacy code creating a faster application and happier users. Designed, implemented the REST XML protocol used between Mendeley Desktop and Web.

Won a place on the [graduate scheme](http://www.btplc.com/careercentre/graduates/index.cfm) which was assessed on potential managerial ability and received management training. Asked to join the internal quality improvement team based on my work in introducing CI.
